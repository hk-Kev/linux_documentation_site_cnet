        <h1 id="page-title">Wazuh Manager (SIEM) and IDS Integration</h1>
        <p>
          This section provides evidence for Task 4 (Wazuh deployment, logging,
          and FIM) and Task 5 (Suricata IDS integration and custom detection
          rules).
        </p>

        <h2>1. Wazuh Manager Setup and Agents</h2>

        <h3>Wazuh Login Screen</h3>
        <p>
          The login screen for the Wazuh manager interface, confirming the
          successful deployment of the OVA (4.14.0) and web access.
        </p>

          alt="Wazuh Manager web interface login screen."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Agent Status and Connectivity</h3>
        <p>
          The Agents tab confirms all required endpoints are enrolled and
          active: the Domain Controller, Linux Documentation Server, and client
          PCs. This centralized monitoring is key.
        </p>

          alt="Wazuh Agents list showing all enrolled VMs are active."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Log Ingestion Verification</h3>
        <p>
          The dashboard view shows incoming logs, including Windows Events and
          syslogs forwarded from pfSense, confirming the successful ingestion of
          security data from all network devices.
        </p>

          class="evidence"
        />

        <hr />

        <h2>2. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)</h2>

        <h3>FIM Configuration for AD/GPO Paths</h3>
        <p>
          Evidence of the `ossec.conf` file snippet or the manager configuration
          confirming the monitoring of critical paths, specifically the
          network-mapped drives and roaming profile folders (e.g.,
          `\\fileserver\roaming\...`).
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/wazuh_fim_ad.png"
          alt="Wazuh FIM configuration settings showing monitored paths for Windows server and network shares."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>FIM Alert Triggered</h3>
        <p>
          A controlled test demonstrates the FIM service working: a file was
          modified in a monitored network share, generating a high-severity
          alert in the Wazuh console.
        </p>

          class="evidence"
        />

        <hr />

        <h2>3. IDS and Custom Rules</h2>

        <h3>Custom Local Rules</h3>
        <p>
          The custom rules file (`local_rules.xml`) includes the
          student-ID-specific rules, such as `StudentID_BruteForce_Windows` and
          `StudentID_Scan_Network`, designed to correlate alerts and adjust
          severity.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/wazuh_local_rules.png"
          alt="Wazuh manager view of the local_rules.xml file containing custom detection rules."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Suricata/IDS Alert (Correlation Proof)</h3>
        <p>
          This evidence (often a duplicate of an earlier Kali test screenshot,
          but included here for context) shows a Suricata (IDS) alert correlated
          and presented in the Wazuh dashboard, proving successful EVE JSON
          ingestion and detection capabilities.
