          This section provides evidence for Task 2, covering the Domain
          Controller installation, DNS configuration, Group Policy
          implementation, and the IIS web portfolio site.

        <h2>1. Active Directory and DNS Setup</h2>

        <h3>Organizational Units (OUs) and Users</h3>

        <p>
          The Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) console view confirms
          the creation of required OUs (IT, HR, Students, Finance) and their
          respective user accounts within them, following the naming convention.
          As well the computers, which joined the "29019.f25" domain.
        </p>

          alt="ADUC console showing all OUs and sample users created."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>DNS Records Verification</h3>

        <p>
          The Domain Name System (DNS) server configuration confirms the forward
          lookup zone for the "29019.f25" domain and the necessary host records
          for the DC and other services. As well showcasing their ip address,
          either dynamically or statically.
        </p>

          src="./images/ad_dns_records.png"
          alt="DNS Manager console showing the forward lookup zone and records for the domain."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <hr />

        <h2>2. Group Policy Objects (GPO) Implementation</h2>

        <h3>GPO Management List</h3>

        <p>
          The Group Policy Management console displays all custom GPOs created
          to enforce central policies across the domain. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>GPO_29019_Password_Policy</li>

          <li>GPO_29019_Roaming</li>

          <li>GPO_29019_MappedDrives</li>

          <li>GPO_29019_SoftwareDeploy</li>
          <li>GPO_29019_NTP</li>
        </ul>

        <img
          src="./images/ad_gpo_list.png"
          alt="Group Policy Management console listing all custom GPOs."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Password Policy Enforcement</h3>

        <p>
          The password policy settings are configured to meet strict security
          requirements (minimum 12 characters, history of 5, and account lockout
          after 3 failed attempts). Also enforcing password complexity, password
          history, and minimum password length.
        </p>

        <img
          src="./images/ad_password_policy.png"
          alt="GPO settings for the domain's strict password policy."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Roaming Profiles Path</h3>

        <p>
          This screenshot shows the File Explorer on the Domain Controller
          (AD-29019), specifically withn the specified path C:\roaming\29019. It
          displays a user profile folder named "Fin1.V2", "HR1.V2", "IT1.V2",
          and "Stud1.V2", which was automatically generated and synchronized
          when the user logs onto the machine. Thus verifying the roaming
          profile (GPO) is successfully.
        </p>

        <img
          src="./images/ad_roaming_profiles.png"
          alt="GPO configuration for the roaming profiles shared folder path."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Client Verification (gpresult)</h3>

        <p>
          This screenshot captures the output of the "gpresult /r" command,
          which was executed on the client machine (PC1-29019) with
          Administrator privileges. Running the command this way forces the
          system to display both the User Settings and the Computer Settings.
          This is critical evidence that proves all GPOs are successfully linked
          and applied to both the user (for Mapped Drives, Roaming Profiles, and
          Software) and the computer (for Password Policy and NTP settings).
        </p>

          alt="Command output showing applied GPOs on a domain client."
          class="evidence"
        />

        <h3>Client Verification (Mapped Drive)</h3>

        <p>
          A screenshot from the client PC (PC1) verifying that the GPO
          successfully mapped the centralized shared drive to this Computer.
        </p>

          class="evidence"
        />

        <hr />

        <h2>3. IIS Web Portfolio Site</h2>

        <h3>Portfolio Site Display</h3>

        <p>
          The personal portfolio site, hosted on the Windows Server's IIS role,
          is displayed. This serves as a public-facing service and confirms
          successful web server setup and network accessibility.
        </p>

          src="./images/ad_portfolio_website.png"
